# Mines Game Debug Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Data Type Mismatch in `revealCell` Function

**Problem**: The frontend was sending `BigInt` values to the `revealCell` function, but the backend expected `Nat` type.

**Solution**: Modified the frontend `mines-integration.js` to convert cell indices to regular numbers before sending to backend.

**Files Changed**:

- `src/APT-CASINO-frontend/src/config/mines-integration.js` - Fixed `revealCell` method to send `Nat` instead of `BigInt`

### 2. Principal Identity Mismatch

**Problem**: The active game exists for one principal, but the user is making calls with a different principal identity, causing `GameNotFound` errors.

**Root Cause**: The frontend might be using different agents/identities for different operations, or there might be identity caching issues.

**Solution**:

- Added extensive debugging to the backend to log all principals and game states
- Added debugging functions: `whoAmI`, `getActiveGameCount`, `debugActiveGames`
- Added utility functions: `clearActiveGame`, `forceEndGame` for recovery

### 3. Inconsistent Error Handling

**Problem**: The `startGame` function was returning `#GameNotFound` error when a game was already in progress, which was confusing.

**Solution**: Changed error type to `#GameNotInProgress` to be more descriptive.

### 4. Missing Debug Information

**Problem**: Insufficient logging made it difficult to debug the principal identity issues.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the backend functions.

## Current State Analysis

From the debug script output:

- Game system is active and properly deployed
- There is 1 active game for principal `7pezs-ixd7s-6krwu-xvt3z-dpdtj-trowk-wxkkm-yx6wm-bc3h3-u4b24-cqe`
- Game has 5 mines and 1 revealed cell
- Game is in `#InProgress` state
- Total volume: 10 APTC bet, 1 game played

## Recommended Actions for User

### If you want to continue the existing game:

1. Make sure you're logged in with the same wallet/identity that started the game
2. The game should work normally after the frontend fix

### If you want to start fresh:

1. Clear the active game: `dfx canister call mines-game clearActiveGame`
2. Or force end the game: `dfx canister call mines-game forceEndGame`
3. Start a new game through the frontend

### For debugging:

- Use the `test_mines_debug.sh` script to check system state
- Check console logs in browser for detailed frontend debugging
- Backend debug logs are now much more verbose

## Technical Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and types
2. **Improved Debugging**: Extensive logging for troubleshooting
3. **Data Type Safety**: Fixed BigInt vs Nat conversion issues
4. **Recovery Functions**: Added functions to clear stuck games
5. **Principal Verification**: Added logging to track identity consistency

## Files Modified

### Backend (`mines.mo`):

- Added debug functions: `whoAmI`, `getActiveGameCount`, `debugActiveGames`
- Added recovery functions: `clearActiveGame`, `forceEndGame`, `clearAllActiveGames`
- Enhanced logging in `revealCell` and `getMyActiveGame`
- Fixed error types in `startGame`
- Added Bool import for debug logging

### Frontend (`mines-integration.js`):

- Fixed `revealCell` to send `Nat` instead of `BigInt`
- Added better validation for cell indices
- Improved error logging

### Utility:

- Created `test_mines_debug.sh` for easy system debugging

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes by trying to reveal cells in the frontend
2. If issues persist, clear the active game and start fresh
3. Monitor the browser console and backend logs for any remaining issues
4. The extensive debugging will help identify any future problems quickly
